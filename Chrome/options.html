    <h2>Whitelist</h2>
    <p>
        Here you can input a whitelist for URLs which should not be hibernated when pressing the "send inactive tabs to sleep"-Button.<br />
        For example: if you want to whitelist "sub.example.com" and "test.example.com", you MUST put them both and can't just type "*.example.com"<br />
        You can also put something like "example.com/path/" in here, if you don't want to whitelist the whole domain.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>URLs must be complete and include http/https!</strong><br />
        <strong>One URL per line!</strong>
