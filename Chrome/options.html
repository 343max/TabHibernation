        <h2>Whitelist</h2>

        <p>Here you can input a whitelist for URLs which should not be hibernated when pressing the "send inactive tabs to sleep"-Button.</p>

        <p>For example: if you want to whitelist "sub.example.com" and "test.example.com", you MUST put them both and can't just type "*.example.com"</p>

        <p>You can also put something like "example.com/path/" in here, if you don't want to whitelist the whole domain.</p>

        <p>
            <strong>URLs must be complete and include http/https!</strong><br />
            <strong>One URL per line!</strong>
        </p>
